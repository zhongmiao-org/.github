> "The Gate of All Mysteries" — Dao De Jing, Chapter 1

## Why “ZhongMiao”?
“ZhongMiao” (众妙) comes from the Dao De Jing, describing the infinite potential of the universe — “The Gateway to All Wonders.”

As an open-source organization, we embrace this philosophy:
- Openness as a gateway: Code should be accessible and generative.
- Collaboration as alchemy: Together, we turn ideas into tools for all.
