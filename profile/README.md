> "The Gate of All Mysteries" — *Dao De Jing, Chapter 1*  

## 🌌 Why "ZhongMiao"?  
"ZhongMiao" (众妙) comes from the ancient Chinese text **Dao De Jing (Tao Te Ching)**, where it describes the infinite potential of the universe — **"The Gateway to All Wonders"**.  

As an open-source organization, we embrace this philosophy:  
- **Openness as a Gateway**: Code, like the Dao, should be accessible and generative.  
- **Collaboration as Alchemy**: Together, we turn ideas into tools that benefit all.
